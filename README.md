# DDGPU - Disable Dedicated GPU

A small program for notebooks which disables your DGPU automatically when it is running on battery.

## Why?

This program is meant to solve a problem for my personal notebook. Driver updates tend to break the notebook's ability to switch between the dedicated and integrated GPU (MSHybrid/Optimus), which causes the battery to drain much faster. Instead of reinstalling or tweaking with the drivers when this happens, I aim to solve this problem with this program.

## Plan

- Full Windows implementation
- Then a Linux implementation
